# Web Scraping Lab

In this project, we will carry out a competitor analyse.
We are a physical auto-dealer far awar from the big cities.
Normally, at our location, the customers purchase their new vehicles based on our trustful reputation. 
They normally choose one the vehicles available stock at our dealer, instead of waiting the production process of a customized vehicle.

In the recent years, some online auto-dealers are delivering the new vehicles door to door of their customers.
The number of vehicles of these online auto-dealers is huge in comparison with the stock we can afford.
Additionally, the prices these online auto-dealers are much lower than our competitive prices.

Our top management is very concern about the future of our company if our customers change their mind and start to purchase their new vehicles online.
We have to search for the available vehicles in the online market and find some parameters that help our management to take decisions, such as, which kind of vehicles should we purchase to avoid differentiation with the online auto-dealers.

## Data acquisition method:
We will use web scraping library Selenium from Python to get as more as possible vehicles from internet webpages.
We will try to compile at least model, kilometers and price.
We have chosen the competitor [clicars.com](https://www.clicars.com/) as it is one of the fastest growing online auto-dealers.
